      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
         One of my favorite movies as a kid growing up was "Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon" (with <a
            href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/" target="_blank">Dune(1984)</a> a close
         second). This was a movie centered around our hero, Leroy Green, and his hero's journey to the legendary glow.
         According to Leroy, it is "where
         the spirit takes over from the mind and guides the body without thought...". Let us meet some of the key
         characters on this hero's journey.

            <h2>The Protagonist - Leroy Green</h2>
            <p>
               Leroy Green is our protagonist, and is a pure soul in a modern world. In the beginning of the movie we
               witness him destroying decoy arrows and catching the "blue arrow" without the knowledge that it was the
               blue arrow. His sensei states that this action has signified he has touched the final level since he
               "knew without knowing". This action ends their relationship as sensei and student and begins Leroy's
               journey to reach the final level and obtain "The Glow".

            <h2>The Antagonist - Sho'Nuff</h2>
            <p>
               Sho'nuff, the Shogun of Harlem. He has a single purpose throughout the whole movie, that is to prove he
               is strongest. He will not rest until everyone knows that Sho'Nuff is the master. Sho'nuff is the mountain
               that Leroy must overcome on his hero's journey. The warrior at the apex, who has also touched the final
               level.

            <h2>The Mob Boss - Eddie Arkadian</h2>
            <p>
               Eddie Arkadian is the second villain in this movie who earned his wealth as the "Video Game King", and is
               looking to expand his business and get into the music video realm. It is his attempts to get his sexually
               suggestive videos played by any means necessary that brings him into contact with Leroy Green. Leroy
               becomes an obstacle to Eddie's plan so how does he deal with it? Money and goons in typical mob boss
               fasion...and a .45 caliber for good measure to put an end to all of the kung-fu crap.

            <h2>The Love Interest - Laura Charles</h2>
            <p>
               Laura Charles is Harlem's hottest video DJ (VJ) and the face of the popular nightclub 7th Heaven. Her
               popularity as a VJ is what attracts the attention of mob boss Eddie Arkadian in his desire to become a
               big time producer and get his video played. Laura declines his initial video screening attempt which he
               tries to arrange through her manager, but she refuses and he ultimately resorts to kidnapping that leads
               to interaction with our protagonist Leroy Green. She believes in Leroy when he doesn't believe in himself
               and says he is no master. She let's him know "Sure look like a master to me."
